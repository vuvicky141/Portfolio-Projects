# Vicky Vu - Projects Portfolio 
## Background - About Me
Hi! Welcome to my portfolio! I did my undergraduate at UC San Diego and Majored in Biochemistry and Cell Biology and minored in Business. During my time at UC San Diego, I took a bioinformatics class and it was my gateway into the world of data science. I floored by how powerful data science can be in revealing so much information in a dataset. I spent my time afterwards learning more and taking on personal projects. Now, I am a Data Analyst working with a medical clinic that utilizes Big Data to manage custom treatment plans for patients with food allergies.

### Personal Projects Highlights
[Predicting Appointment Canellations](https://github.com/vuvicky141/Projects/tree/main/Predicting%20Appointment%20Cancellation)
   * Project: Python, Regression, Classification(Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Data Clearning and Exploration 
   * Dataset: [hist_appt_report.csv](https://github.com/vuvicky141/Projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Appointment%20Cancellation/hist_appt_report.csv)
   * Conclusion: Comparing different models concluded that the Randon Forest model yielded the best and more accurate result of 77%. There various factor identified that  contributed to the model performance and was involed in the model's limitations. 
   
   
[Forecasting Future Appointments](https://github.com/vuvicky141/Projects/tree/main/Forecasting%20Future%20Appointment%20Dates)
   * Project Tools: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Data Cleaning and Exploration 
   * Dataset: [patient_treatment_cycle.csv](https://github.com/vuvicky141/Projects/blob/main/Forecasting%20Future%20Appointment%20Dates/patient_treatment_cycle.csv)
  [appointments_data.csv](https://github.com/vuvicky141/Projects/blob/main/Forecasting%20Future%20Appointment%20Dates/appointments_data.csv)
   * Conclusion: Cross referencing between 2 datasets showed that some appointments have future appointment dates while others do not. After filtering through and identiying the targeted appointment dates, a forecast was given to each patient.    
   
   
### Kaggle Projects Highlights

### Public Tableau Visualization Highlights
Makeover Monday and Workout Wednesday are weekly challenges where participants can utilize public data sources to re-create or construct visuals that convey compelling stories of data. Below are some examples of my work using Tableau.

#### [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/)
>Makeover Monday is your weekly learning and development appointment with yourself and hundreds of passionate data people. For free!
>Join us every Monday to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations and help us make information >more accessible.
>The Makeover Monday community comes together every week from around the globe and we would love for YOU to become part of it, too.
