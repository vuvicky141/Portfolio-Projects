### Public Tableau Visualization Highlights
Makeover Monday and Workout Wednesday are weekly challenges where participants can utilize public data sources to re-create or construct visuals that convey compelling stories of data. Below are some examples of my work using Tableau.

#### [Makeover Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/)
>Makeover Monday is your weekly learning and development appointment with yourself and hundreds of passionate data people. For free!
>Join us every Monday to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations and help us make information >more accessible.
>The Makeover Monday community comes together every week from around the globe and we would love for YOU to become part of it, too.


#### [Workout Wednesday](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/)
>Workout Wednesday is a weekly challenge to re-create a data-driven visualization. The challenges are designed to grow participants >knowledge of Tableau and help kick-start personal development.
>Each Wednesday a challenge is release and participants are asked to replicate the challenge that is posed as closely as possible. >When you think you have it, leave a comment with a link to your visualization, share on Tableau Public, or post on Twitter for >others to enjoy.
