### Background - About Me
Hi! My name is Vicky Vu and welcome to my portfolio! I did my undergraduate at UC San Diego and Majored in Biochemistry and Cell Biology and minored in Business. During my time at UC San Diego, I took a bioinformatics class and it was my gateway into the world of data science. I floored by how powerful data science can be in revealing so much information in a dataset. I spent my time afterwards learning more and taking on personal projects. Now, I am a Data Analyst working with a medical clinic that utilizes Big Data to manage custom treatment plans for patients with food allergies.
